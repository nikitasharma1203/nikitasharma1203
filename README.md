**Data Science student and aspiring Data Analyst** working with real datasets and turning them into clear insights and dashboards.

Focussed on **cleaning messy data, exploring patterns, writing SQL queries, and presenting results** in a way that’s easy to understand and actually useful.

(Yes, I’m also a writer and a trained Bharatanatyam dancer: not strictly required for SQL joins, but surprisingly helpful for storytelling and discipline.)

## Anddd
I’m currently pursuing an **M.Sc. in Data Science** and actively building projects around customer analytics, operational data, and lil bit of machine learning.

I like working at the intersection of **analysis and communication**: figuring out what the data is saying and then explaining it clearly.
