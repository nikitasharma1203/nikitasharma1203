**Data Science student** working with real datasets and turning them into insights and dashboards.

**Cleaning messy data, exploring patterns, writing SQL queries, and presenting results** in a way that’s easy to understand and useful.

(Yes, I’m also a writer and a trained Bharatanatyam dancer: not strictly required for SQL joins, but surprisingly helpful for storytelling and discipline.)
